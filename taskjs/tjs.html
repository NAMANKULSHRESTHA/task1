    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"target="_blank"><img src="./html.png" alt="HTML"></a>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
    <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS.</p>
    <p>THIS COURSE WILL BE OF 1 WEEK.</p>
    <P>COST=Rs 500.</P><br><br>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"target="_blank"><img src="./css3.jpg" alt="CSS"></a>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
    <p>THIS COURSE WILL BE OF 1 WEEK.</p>
    <P>COST=Rs 500.<br><br>
    <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"target="_blank"><img src="./js.png" alt="JS"></a>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
    <p>The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.</p>
    <p>THIS COURSE WILL BE OF 1 WEEK.</p>
    <P>COST=Rs 500.<br><br>
